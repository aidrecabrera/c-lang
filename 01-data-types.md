## Lesson: Data Types in C Programming

The type in the template "type variable_name" refers to the data type of a variable, indicating the kind of information it can store. In C, common data types include int, float, double, and char.

### Common Data Types

- **int:** Represents whole numbers within the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- **float:** Represents numbers with possible decimals, accurate up to 6 decimal places.
- **double:** Represents numbers with possible decimals, accurate up to 15 decimal places.
- **char:** Stores a single character, either a letter or number.

When declaring a variable in C, it is essential to specify its type. Once set, the variable can only store information of that specified type. For example, an int type variable can only store whole numbers.
