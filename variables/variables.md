# Variables in C

## What is a Variable?

The concept of a variable is basically the reference used to store information for future use in the program.

For example, declaring `"int score"` allows you to later assign, change, or compare values.

The basic structure of variable creation involves specifying the type followed by the variable name.

Don't worry; we'll delve into each aspect in detail. We'll cover the creation, naming, assignment, modification, and conversion of variables.

As a valuable tip, you can efficiently create multiple variables of the same type simultaneously by listing them with commas between their names, like "type variable1, variable_2, variable_3, variable4."
