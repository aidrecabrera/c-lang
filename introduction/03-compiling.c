// The way we can run a C program is by compiling it.
// To compile a C program, we use the command gcc.
// Example, to compile this file, we would run: gcc 03-compiling.c -o 03-compiling-compiled
// The -o flag is used to specify the name of the compiled file.
// The compiled file is the executable file that we can run.
